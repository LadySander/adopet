AdoPet

Just a Form I made to test my skills using only HTML and CSS. Its a mock form for an animal adoption app that I envision to make in the future. The idea is that the person chooses various information about themselves, such as how many animals they already have in their household, which species, what type of household it is (a house, an apartment), and the app would show the best animal match for the person to come and visit the animal shelter (previously registered), taking into account several important pre-adoption points like available space, animal welfare, environmental enrichment, species recommended to interact with each other, etc.

The focus of this application would be to facilitate access to animal adoption information available in various media, grouping it in one place. I talked with fellow Veterinarians and currently it seems that in my country (Brazil) there is no similar app.

The SVG logo was also created by me.
